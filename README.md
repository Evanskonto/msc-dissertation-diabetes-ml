MSc Applied Data Science dissertation: Predicting diabetes and related complications using machine learning on BRFSS health data.
# MSc Dissertation – Predicting Diabetes and Its Complications Using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This repository contains my MSc Applied Data Science dissertation, which investigates whether supervised machine learning models can accurately predict:
- Diabetes
- Heart disease / heart attack
- Stroke

using large-scale behavioural and clinical health data.

The goal of the project is to support **early public-health screening** by identifying high-risk individuals using **non-clinical, population-level data**.

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015
- **Size:** 253,680 survey respondents
- **Features:** Demographic, lifestyle, and clinical health indicators
- **Targets:** Diabetes, Heart Disease, Stroke

The dataset is publicly available and ethically suitable for research use.

##  Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Handling class imbalance (e.g. SMOTE)
- Supervised machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated that ML models can predict diabetes and related complications with meaningful accuracy
- Identified the most influential behavioural and health-related risk factors
- Highlighted the potential of data-driven screening using large population datasets
